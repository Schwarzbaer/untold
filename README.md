* History and rewind/forward
* Break Story stuff out of game_repl.py
* Consider i18n/l10 and templating
* Lots of condition improvements
  * any/all/at-least-n/at-most-n for lists of conditions
* Document story syntax (JSON and YAML)
  * ...and remove the stub from story_writer
* Proper story_writer
  * yaml2json story converter (come on, it's just loads() and dumps())
  * Some syntax checking (re: story syntax)
